# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment, **Identum PHP** is under active development and has not yet reached a stable release.
Because of this, **no versions are officially supported** for security updates.

Once the project reaches its first stable release (`1.0.0`), we will maintain a table here indicating which versions are supported for security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we strongly encourage responsible disclosure.

- **Do not create a public issue.**
- Instead, please [open a draft security advisory](https://github.com/astryne/identum-php/security/advisories/new) on GitHub.
- This will notify the maintainers privately so we can investigate and provide a fix before public disclosure.

We will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your report as quickly as possible.
2. Work with you to assess the impact and identify a fix.
3. Release a patched version and publish a security advisory when applicable.

Thank you for helping us keep **Identum PHP** safe and secure for everyone.
